# Python-Imagesearch

This program automatically connects to the zoom session using the imagesearch library.

### How does it work ?

- Detect zoom application on your desktop and click it.
- Clicks the Join a meeting button on the screen that opens
- Fills the meeting informations (meeting ID and Meeting Password)

That's it !!

## Make sure the zoom app is on the desktop before running

# I am using the Turkish version of the application. Therefore, only the Turkish version of the pictures are available at the moment !!!
